When editing a top-level node value directly (e.g., Sudarshan = 0.2):
Siblings under that top-level (e.g., Avinash, Nanda, etc.)
→ Should be redistributed proportionally or evenly to match the new top-level value.

Other top-level nodes (e.g., Shripal, Ishwar, etc.)
→ Should be adjusted proportionally so that the sum of all top-levels remains 1, unless they are locked.
